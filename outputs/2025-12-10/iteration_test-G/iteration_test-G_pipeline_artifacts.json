      "opening_hook": "Ever stared at Google Earth and wondered, \"What if this wasn't controlled by a massive corporation with shareholders to appease?\" What if, instead of being another data point in someone's quarterly revenue report, your 3D scans of that hidden canyon in Utah, the medieval architecture in Prague, or your neighborhood's rapid urban transformation became part of something bigger\u2014something *yours*?",
      "core_argument": "The article advocates for Construkted Globe as a democratic, community-driven alternative to corporate mapping platforms. Instead of allowing corporations to control and profit from collective geographic data, it proposes a system where individuals maintain ownership and control of their 3D scans while contributing to a shared digital Earth that reflects human perspectives rather than commercial priorities.",

        "Your tax dollars funded the satellite imagery, your smartphone captured the Street View images, your drone flights scanned countless sites. Yet when you want to access that data, you're jumping through corporate hoops, dealing with usage restrictions, and essentially renting access to *your own planet*",
        "Corporate mapping sees 'residential structure, wood construction.' We see 'family history, architectural details from 1924, the oak tree planted the same year, the porch where three generations learned to fish'",
