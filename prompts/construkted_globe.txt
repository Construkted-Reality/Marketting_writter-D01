Given the company context and the market research in the GIS space for small business, please write a marketing blog post article talking about the Construkted Globe generated by the public 3d scan data contributed by the users.

Talk about the current state and where it is going. I also need this blog post to encourage users to upload data to help grow the user generated Construkted globe. Talk about the benefits of having a user generated 3d digital globe which is NOT controlled by large corporations (like Google earth, or Bing Maps, and other large corporate overlords doing the mapping).

There are no alterior motives other then to have a user generated dataset with no restrictions. (no restrictions other than the fact that the contributed 3d scans must be of real places)
