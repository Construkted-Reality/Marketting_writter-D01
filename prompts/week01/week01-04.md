**Article 4: "Understanding Point Clouds: The Building Blocks of 3D Data"**
- **Audience**: HOB + PRO
- **Awareness**: Unaware → Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "what is a point cloud"
- **Brief**: Create an educational deep-dive into point clouds. Explain what a point cloud is (a collection of data points in 3D space, each with X, Y, Z coordinates and often additional attributes like color or intensity). Cover how point clouds are created (LiDAR scanning, photogrammetry, structured light). Explain point cloud density and why it matters. Discuss file formats: LAS (industry standard), LAZ (compressed LAS), E57 (interoperability standard), XYZ, PLY. Include visual descriptions of what dense vs. sparse point clouds look like. Explain the relationship between point clouds and meshes. Address practical considerations: file sizes (a typical drone survey might produce 50-500 million points), storage requirements, processing power needed. Do not make this promotional. Target length: 2,000-2,500 words.
