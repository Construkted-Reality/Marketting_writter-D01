- **Awareness**: Unaware → Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "what is 3D mapping"
- **Brief**: Write a comprehensive introduction to 3D mapping for complete beginners. Explain the concept in plain language: 3D mapping is the process of creating three-dimensional representations of real-world environments or objects using various data capture methods. Cover the main technologies involved (photogrammetry, LiDAR, structured light scanning) at a high level without going deep into any one. Include real-world applications: construction site documentation, historical preservation, video game asset creation, urban planning, disaster response. Explain the difference between 3D mapping and traditional 2D mapping/GIS. Do NOT mention Construkted Reality until a brief, natural mention at the end. Focus on education. Include a glossary of 10 key terms (point cloud, mesh, texture, georeferencing, etc.). Target length: 2,000-2,500 words.
