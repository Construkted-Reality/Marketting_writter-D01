**Article 2: "Photogrammetry vs LiDAR: Which 3D Capture Method is Right for You?"**
- **Audience**: HOB + PRO
- **Awareness**: Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "photogrammetry vs lidar"
- **Brief**: Create a definitive comparison between photogrammetry and LiDAR for 3D data capture. Structure as a detailed comparison covering: how each technology works (photogrammetry uses overlapping photos and triangulation; LiDAR uses laser pulses and time-of-flight), accuracy levels (LiDAR typically ±2cm, photogrammetry varies based on GCPs and methodology), cost considerations (drone photogrammetry $1-5K entry; LiDAR sensors $5K-100K+), best use cases for each. Include a comparison table. Discuss hybrid approaches where both are used together. Address common misconceptions: "LiDAR is always more accurate" (not true for all applications), "photogrammetry requires expensive equipment" (smartphone photogrammetry is viable for many uses). Be factual and balanced—don't favor one over the other. Target length: 2,500-3,000 words.
