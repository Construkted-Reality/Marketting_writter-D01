### Week 1: Introduction to 3D Mapping

**Article 1: "What is 3D Mapping? A Complete Beginner's Guide"**
- **Audience**: HOB + PRO
- **Awareness**: Unaware → Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "what is 3D mapping"
- **Brief**: Write a comprehensive introduction to 3D mapping for complete beginners. Explain the concept in plain language: 3D mapping is the process of creating three-dimensional representations of real-world environments or objects using various data capture methods. Cover the main technologies involved (photogrammetry, LiDAR, structured light scanning) at a high level without going deep into any one. Include real-world applications: construction site documentation, historical preservation, video game asset creation, urban planning, disaster response. Explain the difference between 3D mapping and traditional 2D mapping/GIS. Do NOT mention Construkted Reality until a brief, natural mention at the end. Focus on education. Include a glossary of 10 key terms (point cloud, mesh, texture, georeferencing, etc.). Target length: 2,000-2,500 words.

**Article 2: "Photogrammetry vs LiDAR: Which 3D Capture Method is Right for You?"**
- **Audience**: HOB + PRO
- **Awareness**: Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "photogrammetry vs lidar"
- **Brief**: Create a definitive comparison between photogrammetry and LiDAR for 3D data capture. Structure as a detailed comparison covering: how each technology works (photogrammetry uses overlapping photos and triangulation; LiDAR uses laser pulses and time-of-flight), accuracy levels (LiDAR typically ±2cm, photogrammetry varies based on GCPs and methodology), cost considerations (drone photogrammetry $1-5K entry; LiDAR sensors $5K-100K+), best use cases for each. Include a comparison table. Discuss hybrid approaches where both are used together. Address common misconceptions: "LiDAR is always more accurate" (not true for all applications), "photogrammetry requires expensive equipment" (smartphone photogrammetry is viable for many uses). Be factual and balanced—don't favor one over the other. Target length: 2,500-3,000 words.

**Article 3: "The Hidden Costs of Fragmented Geospatial Data (And What to Do About It)"**
- **Audience**: PRO
- **Awareness**: Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "geospatial data management challenges"
- **Brief**: Write a problem-aware article for professionals who struggle with data fragmentation. Address the verified pain points from research: data scattered across multiple platforms and file formats, difficulty sharing with external stakeholders, version control nightmares, hours lost to format conversion. Quantify the problem where possible: cite industry research on time spent on data management vs. actual analysis. Discuss the downstream effects: miscommunication with clients, rework costs in construction (estimated 5-10% of project costs), delays in decision-making. Present solution categories (not specific products): centralized cloud platforms, standardized formats, web-based visualization. Briefly mention how Construkted Reality addresses these issues in the final section. Target length: 1,800-2,200 words.

**Article 4: "Understanding Point Clouds: The Building Blocks of 3D Data"**
- **Audience**: HOB + PRO
- **Awareness**: Unaware → Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "what is a point cloud"
- **Brief**: Create an educational deep-dive into point clouds. Explain what a point cloud is (a collection of data points in 3D space, each with X, Y, Z coordinates and often additional attributes like color or intensity). Cover how point clouds are created (LiDAR scanning, photogrammetry, structured light). Explain point cloud density and why it matters. Discuss file formats: LAS (industry standard), LAZ (compressed LAS), E57 (interoperability standard), XYZ, PLY. Include visual descriptions of what dense vs. sparse point clouds look like. Explain the relationship between point clouds and meshes. Address practical considerations: file sizes (a typical drone survey might produce 50-500 million points), storage requirements, processing power needed. Do not make this promotional. Target length: 2,000-2,500 words.
