**Article 3: "The Hidden Costs of Fragmented Geospatial Data (And What to Do About It)"**
- **Audience**: PRO
- **Awareness**: Problem Aware
- **SEO Target**: "geospatial data management challenges"
- **Brief**: Write a problem-aware article for professionals who struggle with data fragmentation. Address the verified pain points from research: data scattered across multiple platforms and file formats, difficulty sharing with external stakeholders, version control nightmares, hours lost to format conversion. Quantify the problem where possible: cite industry research on time spent on data management vs. actual analysis. Discuss the downstream effects: miscommunication with clients, rework costs in construction (estimated 5-10% of project costs), delays in decision-making. Present solution categories (not specific products): centralized cloud platforms, standardized formats, web-based visualization. Briefly mention how Construkted Reality addresses these issues in the final section. Target length: 1,800-2,200 words.
